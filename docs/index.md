### InProgress...

like users, grating permission on databases that have firewall rules, the agent ip
from terraform must be added and also removed after applying the resources.


## Example Usage

Do not keep your authentication password in HCL for production environments, use Terraform environment variables.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "brunooliveiramac/firewaldbs"
      version = "=1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "firewalldbs" { }

resource "firewalldbs_open" "default" {
  server_name         = "db_server_name"
  resource_group_name = "db_resource_group_name"
  agent_ip            = "192.168.1.1"
}

resource "firewalldbs_close" "default" {
  server_name         = "db_server_name"
  resource_group_name = "db_resource_group_name"
  agent_ip            = "192.168.1.1"
